# SYSTEM.GENESIS – Character Concept Terminal  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
**SYSTEM.GENESIS** is an immersive web-based creative suite for conceptualizing and refining **visual characters** using the power of **generative AI**.  

The application transforms the user into an **operator** working within a **retro-styled terminal interface**, collaborating with AI to design unique characters. The focus is not just on the final design, but also on the **creative journey**, where waiting time becomes part of the narrative experience.

## ✨ Key Features  

### 🎨 Character Generator  
Define your character concept with:

- **Custom text descriptions**  
- **Scene-specific prompts**  
- **Distinct art styles** (anime, cyberpunk, noir, watercolor, etc.)  
- **Reference-based generation**: Upload an image to guide AI output.  

### 🖥️ Live Generation Terminal  
- Replaces standard loading screens with a **retro boot-up simulation**.  
- Displays **live-typing system logs** during image/text generation.  
- Builds immersion with a **hacker/console aesthetic**.  

### 📂 Character Dossier File  
Automatically generated structured profile using **Gemini text models**.  
Includes:  
- **CALLSIGN**  
- **BACKGROUND**  
- **ABILITIES**  
- **WEAKNESSES**  
- **SIGNATURE QUOTE**  

Styled with **subtle text-flicker animations** to enhance narrative depth.  

### 🔄 Non-Destructive Editing Workflows  
- Iterative editing powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**.  
- **In-Page Refinement Chat**:  
  - Modal interface with **filmstrip history** of all versions.  
  - Users can branch edits from any past iteration.  
- **Conversational Editor**:  
  - Side-by-side **image preview + chat log** timeline.  
- **Before & After Comparator**:  
  - Interactive **slider view** to compare original vs. refined generations.

## 🕹️ Immersive UI/UX  
The application is styled like a **classic CRT terminal**:  
- Custom cursor + retro typing effect.  
- Animated **moving orb background**.  
- **Screen flicker** effect reminiscent of old monitors.  
- User customization: Switch **interface glow colors** (green, amber, blue, etc.).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

**Frontend**  
- Built in **Google AI Studio Apps**  
- **HTML, CSS, TypeScript** for the terminal UI  

**AI Models**  
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** → Text generation (dossiers, narrative)  
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview** → Image generation & refinement  

**Backend**  
- Direct **Gemini API** calls (no heavy infrastructure needed)  

**Hosting**  
- Deployed on **Vercel** and **Google AI Studio Apps**

## 📖 Notes  
This is a **conceptual project**, designed to showcase creative workflows with AI for Google x Kaggle Nano Banana Hackathon. It emphasizes **immersion, storytelling, and iteration** as much as the final character design.
