## 🚀 Project Overview  
**SYSTEM.GENESIS** is an immersive web-based creative suite for conceptualizing and refining **visual characters** using the power of **generative AI**.  

The application transforms the user into an **operator** working within a **retro-styled terminal interface**, collaborating with AI to design unique characters. The focus is not just on the final design, but also on the **creative journey**, where waiting time becomes part of the narrative experience.
