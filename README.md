SYSTEM.GENESIS – Character Concept Terminal🚀 Project OverviewSYSTEM.GENESIS is an immersive web-based creative suite for conceptualizing and refining visual characters using the power of generative AI.The application transforms the user into an operator working within a retro-styled terminal interface, collaborating with AI to design unique characters. The focus is not just on the final design, but also on the creative journey, where waiting time becomes part of the narrative experience.✨ Key Features🎨 Character GeneratorDefine your character concept with:Pre-defined archetypes (hero, villain, rogue, mystic, etc.)Custom text descriptionsScene-specific promptsDistinct art styles (anime, cyberpunk, noir, watercolor, etc.)Reference-based generation: Upload an image to guide AI output.🖥️ Live Generation TerminalReplaces standard loading screens with a retro boot-up simulation.Displays live-typing system logs during image/text generation.Builds immersion with a hacker/console aesthetic.📂 Character Dossier FileAutomatically generated structured profile using Gemini text models.Includes:CALLSIGNBACKGROUNDABILITIESWEAKNESSESSIGNATURE QUOTEStyled with subtle text-flicker animations to enhance narrative depth.🔄 Non-Destructive Editing WorkflowsIterative editing powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.In-Page Refinement Chat:Modal interface with filmstrip history of all versions.Users can branch edits from any past iteration.Conversational Editor:Side-by-side image preview + chat log timeline.Before & After Comparator:Interactive slider view to compare original vs. refined generations.🕹️ Immersive UI/UXThe application is styled like a classic CRT terminal:Custom cursor + retro typing effect.Animated moving orb background.Screen flicker effect reminiscent of old monitors.User customization: Switch interface glow colors (green, amber, blue, etc.).🛠️ Technology StackFrontendBuilt in Google AI Studio AppsHTML, CSS, TypeScript for the terminal UIAI ModelsGemini 2.5 Flash → Text generation (dossiers, narrative)Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview → Image generation & refinementBackendDirect Gemini API calls (no heavy infrastructure needed)HostingDeployed on Vercel and Google AI Studio Apps📖 NotesThis is a conceptual project, designed to showcase creative workflows with AI. It emphasizes immersion, storytelling, and iteration as much as the final character design.🧑‍💻 AuthorSYSTEM.GENESIS — A Creative Experiment with Generative AI
